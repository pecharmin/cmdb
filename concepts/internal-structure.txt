Interal Application Structure
=============================

* The program features are implemented in different domains for logical
  separation. The sub/domains are separated by dots like .core.subfeat
* Subdomains must not access their parent domain.
* The data flow goes up from the parents to their childs.
* Domains are not allowed to access their siblings directly.
* References can link domain siblings for data exchange (one direction
  only!) togehter.

* The CMDB core is named '.cmdb.core'.
* There will be more features available under:
** .cmdb.core.auth
   .cmdb.core.auth.db
   .cmdb.core.auth.ldap
** .cmdb.gui
   .cmdb.gui.web
   .cmdb.gui.web.session
